# ⚡ The Data Engine

### *"I don't just write code; I build systems that generate data."*

## 🎯 The Workflow

You might notice my contribution graph is unusually active. My workflow is defined by:

<!-- GITHUB-STATS-START -->
- **📊 High-Velocity Iteration:** ~2370 commits/year since 2019
<!-- GITHUB-STATS-END -->
- **🔬 Granular Observability:** Every change is tracked
- **⚡ Atomic Commits:** Driving automated research pipelines

*I treat development as a continuous experiment where each commit generates data.*

## 🧭 Mission

I'm engineering a **closed-loop "Cognitive and Operational Exoskeleton"**—a system that quantifies human output across physical, technical, and cognitive domains to validate the **Architect-Implementer-Verifier (AIV)** model of human-AI symbiosis. The goal: scale individual productivity by orders of magnitude while actively mitigating cognitive debt through systematic measurement and intervention.

## 🛠️ What I'm Building

### 🎓 The Mastery Engine
A pedagogical operating system using **[Runtime AST Mutation](https://github.com/ImmortalDemonGod/mastery-engine#runtime-ast-mutation)** (surgical bug injection at the semantic level) and **[Shadow Worktrees](https://github.com/ImmortalDemonGod/mastery-engine#shadow-worktrees)** (isolated Git environments for validation) to stress-test engineering skills.

### 🧠 Neural Affinity Framework
Research proving the **["Compositional Gap"](https://github.com/ImmortalDemonGod/arc-taxonomy-reproduction/blob/master/Ingram_Merrit_2025_Neural_Affinity_Framework_ARC.pdf)** (models learn parts perfectly but fail to compose them) in Transformers. Validated against 302+ fine-tuned models.

### 🧬 Geometric Deep Learning (Research Artifact)
**[RNA_PREDICT](https://github.com/ImmortalDemonGod/RNA_PREDICT)**
*Status: [Internal Tool / Reference Implementation]*

A modular pipeline for 3D RNA folding using **TorsionBERT**, **MP-NeRF**, and **SE(3) Diffusion**.
* **The Stack:** PyTorch Lightning, Hydra, Equivariant Neural Networks.
* **The Objective:** Applying geometric constraints to biological foundation models outside of corporate walled gardens.

## 🧬 The Philosophy

> *I operate as an independent lab to bypass the "Golden Handcuffs" of corporate IP capture. My goal is not just research output, but **Operational Sovereignty**—owning the compute, the code, and the discoveries.*

My background is rooted in high-stakes engineering. I started in the **US Navy as a Nuclear Electronics Technician**, where I developed an obsessive focus on:

- ⚙️ **Systems Reliability:** Zero-tolerance for failure in critical systems
- 🔍 **Diagnostic Precision:** Root cause analysis under pressure
- 📐 **Operational Rigor:** Translating Navy discipline into code
