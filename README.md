### ⚡ The Data Engine

> "I don't just write code; I build systems that generate data."

**Miguel Ingram** | Systems Architect & AI Researcher

You might notice my contribution graph is unusually active. My workflow is defined by **High-Velocity Iteration** (~8,000 commits/year) and **Granular Observability**. I treat my development process as a continuous experiment, where atomic commits drive automated research pipelines.


#### 🛠️ What I'm Building
* **[The Mastery Engine](https://github.com/ImmortalDemonGod/mastery-engine):** A pedagogical operating system that uses **Runtime AST Mutation** and **Shadow Worktrees** to stress-test engineering skills.
* **[Neural Affinity Framework](https://github.com/ImmortalDemonGod/arc-taxonomy-reproduction):** Research proving the "Compositional Gap" in Transformers. Validated against 302+ fine-tuned models.

#### 🧬 The Philosophy
My background in **Systems Biology** informs my AI work. I approach Large Language Models not as static math equations, but as complex adaptive systems requiring mechanistic interpretability and rigorous "dissection."
